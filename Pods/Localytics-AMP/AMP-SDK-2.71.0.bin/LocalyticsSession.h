 @class LocalyticsSession
 @discussion The class which manages creating, collecting, & uploading a Localytics session.
 Please see the following guides for information on how to best use this
 library, sample code, and other useful information:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="http://wiki.localytics.com/index.php?title=Developer's_Integration_Guide">
 Main Developer's Integration Guide</a></li>
 </ul>
 
 <strong>Best Practices</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>Instantiate the LocalyticsSession object in applicationDidFinishLaunching.</li>
 <li>Open your session and begin your uploads in applicationDidFinishLaunching. This way the
 upload has time to complete and it all happens before your users have a
 chance to begin any data intensive actions of their own.</li>
 <li>Close the session in applicationWillTerminate, and in applicationDidEnterBackground.</li>
 <li>Resume the session in applicationWillEnterForeground.</li>
 <li>Do not call any Localytics functions inside a loop.  Instead, calls
 such as <code>tagEvent</code> should follow user actions.  This limits the
 amount of data which is stored and uploaded.</li>
 <li>Do not use multiple LocalticsSession objects to upload data with
 multiple application keys.  This can cause invalid state.</li>
 </ul>

 @method shared
 @abstract Accesses the Session object.  This is a Singleton class which maintains
 a single session throughout your application.  It is possible to manage your own
 session, but this is the easiest way to access the Localytics object throughout your code.
 The class is accessed within the code using the following syntax:
 [[LocalyticsSession shared] functionHere]
 So, to tag an event, all that is necessary, anywhere in the code is:
 [[LocalyticsSession shared] tagEvent:@"MY_EVENT"];

#pragma mark - Tag Events Methods
/*!
 @method tagEvent
 @abstract Allows a session to tag a particular event as having occurred.  For
 example, if a view has three buttons, it might make sense to tag
 each button click with the name of the button which was clicked.
 For another example, in a game with many levels it might be valuable
 to create a new tag every time the user gets to a new level in order
 to determine how far the average user is progressing in the game.
 <br>
 <strong>Tagging Best Practices</strong>
 <ul>
 <li>DO NOT use tags to record personally identifiable information.</li>
 <li>The best way to use tags is to create all the tag strings as predefined
 constants and only use those.  This is more efficient and removes the risk of
 collecting personal information.</li>
 <li>Do not set tags inside loops or any other place which gets called
 frequently.  This can cause a lot of data to be stored and uploaded.</li>
 </ul>
 <br>
 See the tagging guide at: http://wiki.localytics.com/
 @param event The name of the event which occurred.
 @param attributes (Optional) An object/hash/dictionary of key-value pairs, contains 
 contextual data specific to the event.
 @param rerportAttributes (Optional) Additional attributes used for custom reporting.
 Available to Enterprise customers, please contact services for more details.
 @param customerValueIncrease (Optional) Numeric value, added to customer lifetime value.
 Integer expected. Try to use lowest possible unit, such as cents for US currency.

#pragma mark - Custom Dimensions Methods

 @method setCustomDimension
 @abstract Sets the value of a custom dimension. Custom dimensions are dimensions
 which contain user defined data unlike the predefined dimensions such as carrier, model, and country.
 Once a value for a custom dimension is set, the device it was set on will continue to upload that value
 until the value is changed. To clear a value pass nil as the value.
 The proper use of custom dimensions involves defining a dimension with less than ten distinct possible
 values and assigning it to one of the four available custom dimensions. Once assigned this definition should
 never be changed without changing the App Key otherwise old installs of the application will pollute new data.

 handles, and facebook IDs.

 it at the last moment.  The session must be opened before any tags can

 is reopened.
